Context

Current slider shows 0 → $1.0B.

Requirement: 0 → $100M+. If user selects the max, include all jobs ≥ $100M.

Rules

Minimal changes; reuse existing slider and formatter.

Keep existing filter state shape and URL sync if possible.

Do not change other sidebar filters.

Tasks

UI constants

In the filter sidebar component or config, set min=0, max=100_000_000.

Update right-end label to display "$100M+" when thumb at max; otherwise show formatted dollar value.

Formatting

Reuse existing compact money formatter; add case: when value === max, render "${short(max)}+" (e.g., $100M+).

Filter state + URL

Ensure stored maxValue can equal 100_000_000. Preserve query param behavior. No schema changes.

Backend query clamp

In jobs fetch/filter logic, apply:

valuation >= minValue

If maxValue === 100_000_000, do not apply an upper bound; else valuation <= maxValue.

Counts/preview

If counts depend on the same range, ensure the unbounded case is respected when at max.

Edge cases

Handle null/undefined valuation gracefully so the filter does not crash.

Deliverables

Updated sidebar slider config and label logic.

Updated server filter condition to treat 100M as unbounded upper cap.

Brief change log listing files touched.

Acceptance Criteria

Slider displays 0 on left and $100M+ on right.

Dragging to midpoint shows e.g. $50M.

Setting to max returns jobs with valuation ≥ $100M, including >$100M (e.g., $250M, $1B).

URL/state restore reproduces the same range after refresh.

No regressions to other filters or map results.

Verification

With unfiltered view, note total job count.

Set range to $0–$50M; results decrease.

Set range to $0–$100M+; results include high-value projects. Confirm with at least one known >$100M job.

Reload page with URL carrying the range; confirm persistence.

Hidden dependencies / blockers

If the server currently hard-caps at $1B, remove that cap.

If formatter lacks compact millions, ensure it already exists or add minimal utility without new deps.
